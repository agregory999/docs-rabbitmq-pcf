This topic provides instructions to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators about how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile to provide on-demand service.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile
as a pre-provisioned service, see
<a href="./install-config-pp.html">Installing and Configuring the Pre-Provisioned Service</a>.</p>

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites for Deploying the On-Demand Service

Before deploying RabbitMQ for PCF as an on-demand service, you must ensure that the required network rules are in place to allow various components to communicate.

See [Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services](about.html#network-rules) for details on the network connections that must be open to enable the on-demand service.

For information about the on-demand service architecture, see [On-Demand Service Architecture](about.html).

## <a id="install"></a> Download and Install RabbitMQ for PCF

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service/).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of RabbitMQ for PCF. This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **RabbitMQ for PCF** tile.
This lets you begin configuring the tile. The installation is complete when you apply the changes from the configuration.

## <a id="tile_configurations"></a> Configure On-Demand RabbitMQ for PCF

The configuration screen below appears when you click the RabbitMQ for PCF tile in Ops Manager. An orange circle beside a tab indicates that you must complete a configuration in the tab. A green checkmark indicates that the tab is preconfigured and you may optionally change its settings.

  </tr>
</table>

### <a id="azs-networks"></a>  Configure AZs and Networks

 Follow the steps below to configure the AZs and networks.

 1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
     <p class="note warning"><strong>Important</strong>: You cannot change the regions or networks after you have clicked **Apply Changes** in the [Apply Changes from Your Configuration](#apply-changes) below.</p>

 2. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** as follows:
   <table>
     <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs. PCF creates the RabbitMQ broker in this AZ.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select additional region. This selection does not affect the on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF service.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
         <td>Select a network for the RabbitMQ On-Demand Broker.<br><br>
             This should be a separate network from the one you select for <strong>Service Network</strong>.
             For more information about the Default Network, see <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.<br><br>
             Typically, you select the network used for the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime components.
         </td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
         <td> Select a separate network that the on-demand service instances run on.<br><br>
              A typical practice is to put all on-demand services on a single network, separate from the network that Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime and the On-Demand Broker run on.
              For information about the Service Network, see <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.<br><br>
              This field is also required for the pre-provisioned service, though in that case, it doesn't matter which network you select.</td></tr>
   </table>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Changing the Network or Service Network after you have configured them, or changing their IP configurations,
       results in a failed deployment.
       For more information, see <a href="./changing-ips.html">Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.</p>

 3. Click **Save**.

### <a id="polling"></a> Set the Metrics Polling Interval

On the **RabbitMQ** tab, set a metrics polling interval. For more information, see [What are Metrics](./monitor.html#metrics).

### <a id='logging'></a>Configure Logging to Monitor RabbitMQ for PCF

Pivotal recommends that you configure logging to monitor the health of RabbitMQ for PCF. Follow [Set Up Syslog Forwarding](./monitor.html#config) to configure logging.


### <a id="global"></a>Configure Global Settings

Follow the steps below to configure global settings.

1. Click **On-Demand Instance: Global Settings** and configure the following:<br><br>
  * **Service instance quota**  min: 0, max: 50  set the total number of on-demand service instances which can be deployed.
For more information, see [Setting Limits for On-Demand Service Instances](./set-quotas.html).<br><br>
  * **VM options**:<br><br>
       **Allow outbound internet access (IaaS-dependent)**. This checkbox must be ticked to allow external log forwarding, sending backup artifacts to external destinations, and communicating with an external BOSH blob store.
         <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Outbound network traffic rules also depend on your IaaS settings. Consult your network or IaaS administrator to ensure that your IaaS allows outbound traffic to the external networks you need.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="service-plan"></a> Configure the Service Plan

To enable the on-demand service, you must configure at least one on-demand plan.

* You can configure up to five on-demand plans: **On Demand Instance: Plan 1 -- On Demand Instance: Plan 5**.
* All on-demand plans can be configured to have 1, 3, 5, or 7 RabbitMQ nodes.
* If the on-demand service is not enabled, the on-demand broker is deployed alongside the RabbitMQ installation, but it is not available in the Marketplace.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must fully configure <strong>On Demand Instance: Plan 1</strong> even if you disable access to this plan (see <strong>CF Service Access</strong> in the table below).</p>


1. Choose the on-demand service instance you want to configure:<br><br>**On Demand Instance: Plan 1** (complete required fields even if you disable this plan):

    ![service-plan-tab-v1.10.0](images/plan-1-configuration.png)

    **On Demand Instance: Plan 2, 3, 4, and 5**:

    ![service-plan-tab-v1.10.0](images/plan-2-configuration.png)

2. Configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable this plan</strong></strong></td>
        <td>(Plans 2 - 5 only) To enable, select **Plan Enable**.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>CF Service Access</strong></strong></td>
    <td>Enable or disable access to this plan, or leave access unchanged.<br><br>
        If you enable Plan 1, the default setting for Plans 2 - 5 is **Enable Service Access**.
        If you change this default setting, the smoke tests fail.
        Therefore, if you enable Plan 1 and want to change this default, before doing so, set the **On-Demand Instance Smoke Tests** errand to **Off**.
        For more information, see [Errands](#errands).<br>
      <br><ul>
        <li>**Enable Service Access**---Gives access to all orgs, and displays the service plan to all developers in the Marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>**Disable Service Access**---Disables access to all orgs, and hides the service plan to all developers in the Marketplace. This setting cannot be selected at a later time in the UI.
        </li>
        <li>**Leave Service Access Unchanged**---Keeps any existing access settings, and only displays the service plan in the Marketplace to members of orgs that have access to the plan. You can change the access settings later using the cf CLI. For instructions, see [Controlling Access to Service Plans by Org](./control-access.html).
        </li>
      </ul></td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan name</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a name. This is the name that appears in the Marketplace.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan description</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter a description.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service instance quota</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the maximum number of on-demand service instances that can be available at one time. For more information, see [Setting Limits for On-Demand Service Instances](./set-quotas.html).</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Plan features</strong></td>
        <td>Accept the default or enter information about the plan to help your app developers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Number of nodes</strong></strong></td>
        <td>Enter 1, 3, 5 or 7. This setting only affects new service instances.
            Previously deployed service instances are **not** updated.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network partition behaviour</strong></strong></td>
        <td>Select <code>pause_minority</code> or <code>autoheal</code>. Pivotal recommends using pause minority.
            For more information, see <a href="./ondemand.html#tradeoff">Consistency or Availability Tradeoff</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>RabbitMQ VM Type</strong></td>
        <td>Select a large VM type. The plan creates a service instance of this size. For more information, see <a href="#resources">Understanding RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size</a> below. </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Persistent disk type</strong></td>
    <td>This is where RabbitMQ pages messages to disk.
    Service instance deployments fail if this value is less than twice the volume of RAM of the selected RabbitMQ VM Type.
    For more information, see <a href="#resources">Understanding RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size</a> below.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>AZ placement</strong></td>
    <td>This field is available after you complete the [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs-networks) page.
        <ul><li>For a single-node plan, select one or more AZs.</li>
          <li>For a plan containing multiple nodes, select only one AZ.
        Pivotal recommends this for multi-node plans to minimize risks due to network latency and partitions. See <a href="./ondemand.html#latency">Network Latency</a> and <a href="./ondemand.html#tradeoff">Consistency or Availability Tradeoff</a> for details.
        <br><br>If you change this selection after deployment, existing instances are not affected by the change. See [Determine which AZs a Service Instance Uses](#determineaz).</li>
      </ul></td></tr>
  </table>


3. Click **Save**.

#### <a id="determineaz"></a> Determine which AZs a Service Instance Uses

<p class='note warning'><strong>Important</strong>: If you change this configuration after you have selected AZs and deployed service instances,
       existing instances are <strong>not</strong> placed in the newly configured AZs when the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand is run.
       This prevents re-creation of the VMs in different AZs, which can lead to data loss.
       <br>All new service instances, however, will be created in the newly configured AZs.</p>

<br>To determine which AZs a service instance is placed in, do one of the following:

<ul><li>Retrieve the service GUID using the <code>cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE --guid</code> command
       and then run the BOSH <code>instances</code> command for the <code>service-instance_GUID</code> deployment.</li>

  <li>With syslog forwarding enabled, inspect the service broker logs
          when running the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand. For each existing service instance, the log message includes the service instance GUID and the AZs the service instance is running in.</li>
</ul>


#### <a id="resources"></a> Understanding RabbitMQ VM Types and Persistent Disk Size

The **RabbitMQ VM Type** and **Persistent disk type** are required fields on the service plan configuration pages.
If you are installing on PCF v2.0 or later, these properties are pre-configured by default.

<%= image_tag("images/vm-ram-disk-example.png") %>

Pivotal recommends that the value of **Persistent disk type** be twice the amount of RAM of the selected **RabbitMQ VM Type**.

* You can change the RabbitMQ VM type and the size of the persistent disk that is attached to the RabbitMQ instances. For example, if you are running out of disk space you may want to increase the persistent disk size by changing the **Persistent disk type** field. If you make changes, ensure that the persistent disk size is still twice the size of the RAM of the RabbitMQ VM type.

* RabbitMQ raises alarms when disk space drops below the configured limit.
Incorrect disk sizes might cause the deployed instance not to start.
RabbitMQ declines to start if there is not enough space available according to the threshold.

* On-Demand instances are configured with a threshold set to the 150% of the memory (RAM) of the VM.
Use the following table as a guide when selecting the size of the persistent disk.

The following table shows an example of possible RAM values, absolute minimal value below which
RabbitMQ declines to start, and the disk size suggested for an average use case.

<table border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Free disk alarm threshold (1.5xRAM)</td>
    <th>Suggested disk size (2xRAM)</th>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10 GB</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>20 GB</td>
  <tr>

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Verify the Stemcell

1. Click **Stemcell**.

2. Verify and, if necessary, import a new stemcell version.
    For more information, see the information about importing the stemcell for your IaaS:
    [AWS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/customizing/pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#stemcell),

    [vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#stemcell).


### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration

Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes. Follow the steps below:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

2. Click **Apply Changes**.



## <a id='errands'></a>Errands

When deploying or updating RabbitMQ for PCF, Ops Manager can optionally 
run a series of [Post-Deploy Errands](#post-deploy-errands). 
An example is the `Smoke Tests` errand, which checks the health of the RabbitMQ cluster after a deploy or upgrade.

You can decide whether to run errands by toggling them on or off before an update. 
This is a one-time setting on the installation dashboard:

![Configuring One-time Errands](images/errands-installation.png)

<p class='note warning'><strong>Important</strong>: As of RabbitMQ for PCF v1.9.0, all post-deploy errands are on by default.
    Pivotal recommends keeping these defaults, because the smoke tests can encounter unexpected issues,
    and on-demand instances of RabbitMQ for PCF may fall behind
    if the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand is not on by default.</p>

However, if necessary, you can change these defaults by clicking **Errands** in the RabbitMQ for PCF **Settings** tab.

For more information on errand run rules, 
see [Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/managing_errands.html#rules).

For more information on errands, see [Errands](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

    <td>Removes the on-demand RabbitMQ service from the Marketplace</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### <a id="on_demand_instance_smoke_test_process"></a> On-Demand Instance Smoke Test Process

Smoke tests only run against Plan 1. The smoke tests perform the following steps:

1. Create and target the org <code>smoke-test-org</code> and the space <code>smoke-test-space</code> to run the tests.
1. Deploy an instance of the [RabbitMQ Example App](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/rabbit-example-app) in this cf space.
1. Create the RabbitMQ cluster and bind it to the CF RabbitMQ Example App.
1. Check that the CF RabbitMQ Example App can write to, and read from, the RabbitMQ service instance.
1. Clean up the deployed Example App and all its service bindings.
1. Delete the cf org and space created for the tests.

## <a id="admin-service-key"></a>Create an Admin User for a Service Instance

If you want to give app developers admin privileges to the RabbitMQ Management UI, you can create an admin user for a service instance and share the user credentials with app developers.

Both operators and app developers can use this procedure.

To create an admin user on a RabbitMQ instance do the following:

1. Run this command to create a service key:

    <br>`cf create-service-key SERVICE_INSTANCE SERVICE_KEY -c '{"tags": "administrator"}'`

    <br>where:

    <br>`SERVICE_INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`. <br> `SERVICE_KEY` is a name you choose to identify the service key.

    <br>For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf create-service-key my-instance my-admin-key -c '{"tags":"administrator"}'<br>
   Creating service key my-admin-key for service instance my-instance as user<span>@</span>example.com...
   OK
</pre>

1. Run this command to get the admin user credentials:

    <br>`cf service-key SERVICE_INSTANCE SERVICE_KEY` where the variables are the same as above.

    <br>This returns a Dashboard URL containing the admin credentials, which can be used to access the management UI. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf service-key my-instance my-admin-key<br>
   Getting key my-admin-key for service instance my-instance as user<span>@</span>example.com...
   {
     "dashboard_url": "https://my-instance.bosh-lite.com/#/login/admin-username/admin-password",
     "username": "admin-username",
     "password": "admin-password",
     ...
   }
</pre>
